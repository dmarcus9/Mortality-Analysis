The proposal should include:- A brief articulation of your chosen topic and rationale- A link to your dataset(s) and a screenshot of the metadata if it exists.	      https://www.kaggle.com/cdc/mortality/home - 3-4 screenshots of relevant "inspiring" visualizations that frame your creative fodder- A sketch of the final design 	- A link to the primary GitHub repository you'll be housing your work in       https://github.com/Gonzalez-Mauricio/Project2_DeathsInTheUsAnalysis Title:    	We’re All Gonna Die.Subtitle: 	But how?    &   How scared should you be about certain potential ends?  We will examine the causes of death and the prevalence of each…i.e. the probability that you die from x, compared to fears people have of dying from x.Random causes like sharks, lightning, ripcurrents…More serious causes like terrorism, mass shootings, school shootings, suicide, HIVYour project must include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g. menus, dropdowns, textboxes, etc.):users will be able to filter based on bins of age, or top/bottom 5 causes, or gender, or being a smoker, or living in urban/rural environments, married, race, earthquake regions, coastal regions, in a particular state…Related topics: Health, psychology (prevalence of phobias), probability, and related statistics.Impetus / inspiration:We have all heard people express certain phobias, e.g. I am afraid to swim in the ocean because I am worried that I will get bit by a shark…and a common response is:“You are more likely to die x (e.g. driving) than being bitten by a shark, and yet you probably drive without much fear, no?”         And other related sayings / myths / urban myths. Could quantifying and visualizing actual causes of death offer some perspective and ideally dispel some fears people have?
